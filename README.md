"Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis:

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking cancellations to uncover patterns, trends, and key factors influencing cancellations. Utilizing a dataset comprising booking details, customer information, and reservation dates, I employed exploratory data analysis techniques to identify correlations between variables such as booking lead time, seasonality, guest demographics, and cancellation rates.

By implementing advanced data visualization tools and statistical methods, I visualized booking trends over time, segmented cancellations by guest type, and evaluated the impact of factors like booking channels and room preferences on cancellation probabilities. Additionally, I employed machine learning models, including logistic regression and decision trees, to predict the likelihood of cancellations based on relevant features.

The insights gained from this analysis provided actionable recommendations to optimize hotel booking processes and minimize cancellation rates. Through a deeper understanding of customer behavior and preferences, the project aimed to empower the hotel management with strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and revenue by strategically managing cancellations."
